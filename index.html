      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p> Hello, my name is Lance Rosengarten and this is where I share my journey from customer service/sales to cybersecurity.</p>
      <p> In 2012, I started college studying Information Technology and game software development, mainly focusing around C+/C#. 
        A couple years later, the school closed down and my credits had no standing at any other college or Universities. With large amounts
       of student loan debt, I worked customer service and sales jobs but kept my passion for Information Technology and enjoyed supporting the
       local IT teams. </p>
       <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to actively make a career change into the IT field, specifically cybersecurity/ethical hacking.  
       Unsure where to begin, I started my learning experience on Hack the Box and following different Content Creators in the Cyber industry.
       In 2022, (ISC)2 was offering their Certified In Cybersecurity self pace course and exam for free and grasped my interest. 
       After finishing the course, I scheduled my exam and made sure to give myself some time to study up on the terminology.
       In March 2023, I took the exam and passed on my first try. </p>
       <p> In the same month, I started a three month internship as a GRC Analyst with Cyvergance.AI. Within a month, I became a Team lead supporting 20 other Analyst.
        During the three months, we conducted risk assessments using different frameworks, presented risk to technical and non-technical audiences, and drafting policies and procedures.
        After the three months, I graduated from the internship with honors and awarded Best Performing Team, Intern of week, the Extra Mile Award and offered to continue on with Cyvergance.AI as a Team Lead for the SOC Analyst. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I continue as a Cybersecurity Consultant for Cyvergance.AI, keeping my responsibilities of supporting over 50 GRC and SOC analyst and being on the management team.
        In October, I passed the CompTIA Security+ exam and I am continuing to study for exams, for 2024, I plan on taking on the (ISC)2 CISSP. 
        I sharpen my skills on the Hack The Box platform using academy modules and labs, home labs, and practice coding in Python. 
       </p>
       <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy spending it with my wife and daughter, playing video games, watching movies, playing at parks and water parks, build PCs, and continue learning about cybersecurity.
